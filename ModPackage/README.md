# Infinite Emotes
 
Loosens the CheckConditionsForEmotePatch to allow emoting while running and jumping

## Config

There is a key (0 by default) to stop emoting, emotes can also be stopped by crouching or interacting with things like ladders, terminal or 2 handed objects

## Known gripes

- Emoting negates any animations so you wont see running animations etc
- Clicking the same emote button will not stop the emote, this is a limitation that is here to stay to allow for compatibility with MoreEmotes

 ## Changelog

 Changelog can be found in the release section of the github repo (makes it easier for me to maintain it)
